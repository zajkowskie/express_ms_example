## 0. Intruduction
This project was created to learn principals of microservices with nodejs express api.
After i watched https://github.com/codergogoi YT [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXDkgjU8DDU), i tought it will be greate to make generator for microservices, which is easy scallable.


## 1. Usage
Just type `npm install` and after that `npm run create --name=testService --port=testServicePort` and all will be created in seconds.

After that just go to `testService` folder and type `npm run`. You have working microservice template, of corse without logic.

## 2. Reminder
Remember to remove .git folder :)
